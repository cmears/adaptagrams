# We use gnu automake to build.  I've tried to make the contents of the
# repository as platform agnostic as possible, so you'll need to call
# autoreconf before configure.

# Make m4 directory, otherwise autoreconf fails when it doesn't exist.
mkdir -p m4

autoreconf --install --verbose

# The following sequence is are the manual steps if autoreconf isn't available.
#
#aclocal $ACLOCAL_FLAGS
#glibtoolize
#autoheader
#autoconf
#automake -a --add-missing


# Configure.  Use the commented out line instead if building for SWIG:
# ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DUSE_ASSERT_EXCEPTIONS"
./configure

make

# The following builds examples and tests for each of the libraries.
# Please look at these before sending me questions.
make check
